# Talend Data Preparation - Cucumber test
![alt text](https://www.talend.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/talend-logo.png "Talend")

This folder contains the the Data Preparation API cucumber tests. 

## Prerequisites

You need Java *8* (or higher), Maven 3.x. and dataprep-api jar in your maven repository

## Launch integration tests
There are different ways to run Cucumber integration tests :
* Launch maven test goal on dataprep-test-api project 
* Launch OSRunnerConfigurationTest class as a JUnit test in you preferred IDE
* Use a dependent IDE Cucumber plugin to lunch a specific feature file.  

_Note : 
Data-prep backend service is configured in dataprep-test-api/application.properties file.
Be sure adapt it to your own configuration before launching the integration tests._

### Maven launch
To launch all cucumber test, you have to call the test maven phase. 
```
$ mvn test
```
It's possible to launch a specific test by specifying it in the command line:
```
$ mvn test -Dcucumber.options="classpath:features/os/ExportPreparation.feature"
```
By default cucumber test will call the backend api on http://dev.data-prep.talend.lan:8888.
You can set another url value with the maven parameter:
```
$ mvn clean test -DmyKey=http://backend.api.server.url
```
Available key are:
* ``backend.api.url`` : to specify the global api base url
* ``restassured.debug`` : to switch on RestAssured library debug logs (default value : false) 

## Report
The default cucumber report will be available on the ``target/cucumber directory``.
If you want a more readable cucumber report just launch the command line:

```
$ mvn test verify
```

The cucumber report will be available on /site/cucumber-reports

## Adding new features

### Using and cleaning context
Some of data-prep items like dataset, preparation, folders, etc.
are stored under a feature temporary local context (see `GlobalStep.java`).
This context is used for two reason :
* Share references to items between scenarios and steps within a feature
* Clean the environment at the end of a feature to keep the tests re-entrant 

For this last functionality, it is mandatory to add the following annotation on the last scenario of your new feature : 
```
@CleanAfter
```
The ``@CleanAfter`` annotation just call a cleaning procedure in the test environment to delete all the created stuff in the right order.  

### Write new Java steps (classes inheriting from `DataPrepStep`)
* Don't forget to register any created item in the context in order to have it cleaned by ``@CleanAfter``
* As the values passed to the folder API differs depending on the environment, always use ``folderUtil`` functions first instead of direct ``OSDataPrepAPIHelper`` calls, in order to keep your features runnable in an on premise environment.
